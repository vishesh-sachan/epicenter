 *
 * Moonshine's ONNX files don't self-describe their architecture (unlike Whisper .bin files
 * which contain metadata, or Parakeet which includes config.json). The variant ("tiny" or
 * "base") tells transcribe-rs the layer count and hidden dimensions needed to load the model.
 *
 * Rather than storing variant separately, we encode it in the `directoryName` (e.g.,
 * "moonshine-tiny-en", "moonshine-base-en") and extract it at transcription time using
 * `extractVariantFromPath()`. This avoids redundant metadata while keeping our download
 * configs simple.
 *
 * Variant architecture:
 * - "tiny": 6 layers, head_dim=36 (~30 MB quantized)
 * - "base": 8 layers, head_dim=52 (~65 MB quantized)
